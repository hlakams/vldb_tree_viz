# VLDB Demo Tree Visualizationn

This demo uses `react-d3-tree` with Next.js to render a database schema tree.
Configure DB schema as needed in `tree_config.js`, and render the component using a call to `DatabaseTreeDisplay()`. 

Todo:
* Relational algebra operators shown as node contents, not labels
* Read schema from file
* Native export to SVG
